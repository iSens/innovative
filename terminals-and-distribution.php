                At Innovative, we are committed to continuous improvement and have established a Quality Management System for controlling our product quality from raw material to finished product. We have on site labs that allow us to measure quality throughout the manufacturing process.

                Our state-of-the-art control system allows us to accurately blend different product recipes at our loading rack. The system captures highly accurate flow rates through our Coriolis meters and measures specific gravity in real time to ensure the integrity of the blending. In addition, as part of our comprehensive quality control and quality assurance program we have a high frequency sampling protocol post product loading.

            <p class="inn__main-text">
                All of these processes have allowed us to achieve a defect rate of less than one half of one percent.
